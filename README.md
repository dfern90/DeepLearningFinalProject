# DeepLearningFinalProject
For my Final Project, I am going to attempt to do object recognition with the help of our good friend the convolutional neural network (CNN). Object recognition is a computer vision technique that takes images or video and classifies the objects within them. I will take an image dataset with 7 categories and attempt to categorize them utilizing our CNN model. I will also compare the results of our CNN against a forward feed neural netword (FNN) and a transfer model. I will then analyze the initial results and attempt to improve the model by tuning the hyperparameters.

The data for this project comes from this kaggle images dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansanagapati/images-dataset.

The dataset contains one file titled 'data' with 7 directories. These directories include 'bike', 'cars', 'cats', 'dogs', 'flowers', 'horses', and 'human'. Each of these directories has anywhere from 202-420 images, all of varying sizes. This issue will be addressed in our data cleaning phase.
